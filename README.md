# Computer Architecture

Implementation of the ARM assembly processor architecture shown here: https://class.ece.uw.edu/469/hauck/lectures/05_Nonpipelined.pdf

The following files were not designed by me, all credit to Prof. Hauck @ University of Washington: D_FF.sv, math.sv, all files in Memories, all benchmarks

Implemented once as a single-cycle CPU (see Single Cycle Files) and once as a pipelined CPU (see Pipeline Files)

All modules deliberately designed with almost no RTL. The intention was to more accurately simulate gate delays.
